qradar2thehive python script was created to use TheHive as an incident response platform for the IBM QRadar SIEM.
I made it as simple as possible so that everyone could adapt it to their needs.
It requires a little configuration. All the details are described in the comments of the script.
Any improvement is welcome.
Many thanks to The Hive project team for their outstanding work: https://github.com/TheHive-Project
